## Core Features:

- Dispensing Input: Input form for dispensing drugs to patients, with drug selection via dropdown menu and field for number of strips dispensed. Patients names may be manually typed into the application.
- Automatic Stock Update: Automatic inventory stock update, decrementing stock based on the dispensing input form. Stock updates on page.
- Low Stock Alert: Visual flagging of drugs below a threshold; this value is globally configured on the setting's page.
- Restock Logging: Input form to log new stock, tracking date and quantity of each drug received.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light-to-medium blue (#5DADE2) to evoke a sense of trust and health. This primary color should appear in interactive elements of the dispensing and restocking pages.
- Background color: Light gray (#ECF0F1) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop that is gentle on the eyes.
- Accent color: Soft teal (#45B39D) for positive alerts such as successful stock updates. Low stock alerts should be in an analogous color on the opposite side of the primary, like soft orange (#E67E22).
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality, and it is suitable for both headlines and body text in this case.
- Use universally recognized icons for common functions like adding stock or submitting forms. Health-related iconography such as pills can be used.
- Clear sections for input, stock display, and alerts; use a grid layout for clear hierarchy and mobile responsiveness.
- Subtle transitions to indicate stock updates and flag alerts, reinforcing interaction feedback.
